# My Availability Lightning Component for Field Service

### Motivation behind it

Salesforce released an exiciting product in 2016 called ['Field Service Lightning'](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/features/field-service-lightning/)
FSL is missing a feature - the ability for technician to log their availability within the next weeks. This is not an issue for permanent employees, but definitely one for contractors who manage their own calendars.

### Installation instructions
